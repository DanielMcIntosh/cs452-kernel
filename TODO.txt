TODO:
Clean up parameter order - mostly in track_state and train_state

change sensor attribution to use bfs with starting nodes of _all the trains_ last sensors

when we change speed, find a way to put off adjusting velocity calibration

change CURRENT_SPEED to 0? and stop double-inverting train->speed

actually set train->direction

find instances of RunWhen
